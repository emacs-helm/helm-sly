#+TITLE: Helm-SLY

Helm for [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][SLY]], a Common Lisp interaction mode for Emacs.

* Installation

Add =helm-sly.el= to your load-path.
Set up SLY properly.

To use Helm instead of the Xref buffer, enable ~global-helm-sly-mode~.

To enable Helm for completion, two options:

- Without company:

  #+begin_src lisp
  (add-hook 'sly-mrepl-hook #'helm-sly-disable-internal-completion)
  ;; If you want fuzzy-matching:
  (setq helm-completion-in-region-fuzzy-match t)
  #+end_src

- With company, install [[https://github.com/Sodel-the-Vociferous/helm-company][helm-company]], then:

  #+begin_src lisp
  (add-hook 'sly-mrepl-hook #'company-mode)
  (require 'helm-company)
  (define-key sly-mrepl-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-company)
  #+end_src

* Usage

Helm-SLY defines a few new commands:

- helm-sly-list-connections :: Yet another Lisp connection list with `helm'.

- helm-sly-apropos :: Yet another ~apropos~ with Helm.

- helm-sly-mini :: Like ~helm-sly-list-connections~, but include an extra source
                   of Lisp-related buffers, like the events buffer or the
                   scratch buffer.
